# cmux Cloud devbox image (Freestyle)

The devbox definition for cmux Cloud machines. The Dockerfile here is the
reference recipe: Ubuntu 24.04 (the distro every Freestyle machine runs),
the shell layer, and the **desktop layer** from `desktop/`, started by the
`cmux-devbox-boot` supervisor when there is no systemd (`docker build` proves
the whole desktop at build time). `web/scripts/build-devbox-freestyle.ts`
builds the same devbox on top of the `freestyle/ubuntu` base VM: it reads the
desktop package list, the Ghostty `.deb` and the agent pins from the
Dockerfile's `ARG`s (`devbox-image-common.ts`) and installs the desktop files
through the one `DEVBOX_DESKTOP_INSTALLS` map, so the two recipes cannot
drift. Parity targets are the chatmux devbox
(`chatmux:infra/sandbox-images/Dockerfile`) for the shell layer: same
devtools, node/python/bun, uv, gh, Chrome + cua-driver, pinned coding agents,
ble.sh ghost text, half-life prompt, seeded history, and the coderouter
agent-config generator.

On Freestyle the toolchain is the base's, not mise: `freestyle/ubuntu`
already ships Node LTS under nvm (symlinked into `/usr/local/bin`), Bun,
Python 3.12, uv, Docker (running from boot), and its own copies of Claude
Code, Codex and OpenCode. The bake keeps all of that and replaces the agent
copies with the exact Dockerfile pins (`npm install -g` on the base's npm,
every agent bin symlinked into `/usr/local/bin` so daemon panes resolve them
without a login profile). The work user is the base's **`ubuntu`** (uid
1000, passwordless sudo, the API's default exec user and the SSH default);
the bake creates no users. A cmux login banner (`cmux-motd`, rendered by
pam_motd on SSH) replaces the stock Ubuntu and Freestyle motd text.

`vm-devbox-image.test.ts` pins the shared files (`cmux-bashrc`,
`agent-config.sh`, `seed-history`, `chrome-managed-policy.json`) to their
chatmux counterparts, so edit both copies together.

## Desktop layer (`desktop/`)

Ported from the retired Blaxel `sandbox/cmux-devbox` image, the same stack
on every provider: TigerVNC serving an openbox session with the tint2 dock
(Chrome, Files, Ghostty), Thunar, the CC0 mountain-lake wallpaper, the
accessibility bus for computer-use, TigerVNC's clipboard helper, and noVNC
on 6901. The contract (`web/services/vms/images/desktop.ts`;
`vm-devbox-desktop.test.ts` pins it, the Mac app's Displays row, the CLI's
`cloudVMDesktopPort` and the Freestyle driver's `openPort` depend on it):

- `start-vnc.sh` runs as the work user `ubuntu` with `HOME=/home/ubuntu`
  and `DISPLAY=:1`, so the desktop session is the same account terminals
  and SSH land in; RFB on **5901 loopback-only** (no VNC auth: the owner's
  private network is the only ingress), noVNC via websockify on **6901**
  at `/`. Idempotent: every component is guarded by a liveness probe.
- The session runs one D-Bus session bus (reused across supervisor passes),
  the accessibility bus (`at-spi-bus-launcher --launch-immediately`, so
  `cua-driver`'s `get_window_state` resolves window trees), openbox, feh
  (wallpaper), tint2, `vncconfig -nowin` (clipboard between the noVNC pane
  and X apps), a resize watcher (noVNC remote resize re-fills the wallpaper
  and nudges the dock), and websockify.
- It publishes `DISPLAY` and the accessibility bus (`AT_SPI_BUS_ADDRESS` for
  AT-SPI clients, `AT_SPI_BUS` for `cua-driver doctor`) at `/run/cmux-desktop/env`
  (the unit's `RuntimeDirectory=`, owned by `ubuntu`, readable by all).
  `/etc/cmux/desktop-env.sh`, sourced by `/etc/profile.d/cmux-desktop.sh`
  and the bashrc chain (every pane the cmux-tui daemon opens, root's
  included), points any shell without a `DISPLAY` at the desktop while it
  is up, so `agent-browser`, `xdotool` and `cua-driver mcp`/`call` act on
  the screen a person can watch. The session's own user also inherits its
  D-Bus session bus; root does not (the bus admits only its owner). Root
  can reach the display itself (`cmux` sessions run as root).
- Readiness is signalled by its owners, never inferred from elapsed time:
  Xvnc reports its display on `-displayfd` once it accepts connections, the
  accessibility bus is awaited by name (`gdbus wait org.a11y.Bus`), the
  resize watcher reacts to RandR events (`xev`), and the unit is
  `Type=notify`: `start-vnc.sh` sends READY once the display, noVNC and the
  published env are up, so `systemctl start cmux-desktop` (the driver's
  port-open heal, the bake) returns exactly when the screen is usable.
  websockify has no readiness signal of its own, so its 6901 bind is the one
  bounded connect wait (`wait_listening`).
- The `cmux-desktop` systemd unit runs `cmux-desktop-boot` as `ubuntu`,
  which re-asserts Chrome's pre-accepted first run and re-runs the
  idempotent `start-vnc.sh` every 30 s. In a container (no systemd) the
  `cmux-devbox-boot` boot supervisor starts the same `cmux-desktop-boot` as
  the uid-1000 account and restarts it if it exits; under systemd it starts
  nothing (the bake and the verifier count exactly one desktop supervisor).
- `ubuntu` has passwordless sudo, so coding agents' root-refusing modes
  (`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`) work. The Freestyle driver still
  runs the cmux-tui daemon as root; moving sessions to `ubuntu` is a driver
  change.
- Ghostty comes from a pinned community `.deb` for Ubuntu 24.04
  (`ARG CMUX_IMAGE_GHOSTTY_DEB_URL` in the Dockerfile, verified against
  `ARG CMUX_IMAGE_GHOSTTY_DEB_SHA256` before dpkg runs); the apt list is
  `ARG CMUX_IMAGE_DESKTOP_PACKAGES`. `devbox-image-common.ts` reads all three.

Desktop and base defaults use separate snapshots. `--no-desktop --kinds base`
builds the shell-only base ladder; the verifier reads `/etc/cmux/image-stamp`
and rejects a desktop snapshot passed as a base image.

The Freestyle base slug is only the input to the cmux bake. The ids recorded in
`manifest.json` are cmux-derived snapshots, created by baking cmux-tui and its
contract first, then resizing and re-booting each shape. Never point a machine
at a raw `freestyle/*` base, because it has no cmux-tui state or startup
contract.

Reaching it: the Freestyle driver's `openPort(vmId, 6901)` (the app's
Displays row, `cmux vm open <m>:desktop`) returns
`http://<private VPC IPv4>:6901/vnc.html?path=websockify`, reachable only
over the owner's WireGuard tunnel, exactly the path the daemon route takes,
after a guest-side heal that is one blocking `systemctl start cmux-desktop`
(the unit's READY is the signal). No public ingress is ever opened for it: noVNC has no
auth of its own, so a machine outside a private network gets an error, not
a public URL. `desktopWrapper.ts` stays the seam for a future public TLS
edge. The daemon still runs as root, so root shells get `DISPLAY` but not
the session bus.

## Identity: the machine is `cmux`

`web/services/vms/images/identity.ts` is the contract. The Freestyle base
calls every VM `freestyle-vm` (static in `/etc/hostname`, the `127.0.1.1`
alias in `/etc/hosts`, the comment on its SSH host keys), so before this
contract a cmux machine introduced itself as the provider's in every pane
(`root@freestyle-vm in ~ λ`), in `hostname`, `$HOSTNAME`, `uname -n`, the
journal, and the host-key comments. The bake's `identity` step, right after
the base inventory, renames it:

- **Hostname `cmux`**, static and live (`hostnamectl set-hostname`, with a
  file-plus-`sethostname` fallback), and the `127.0.1.1 cmux` alias so
  `getent hosts cmux` and sudo resolve it. Only the alias line of
  `/etc/hosts` changes; the provider's `# BEGIN freestyle-tls-egress` block
  and every other line stay byte for byte.
- **SSH host keys regenerated** under the new name (the base's keys were
  generated when Freestyle built its rootfs and are shared by every VM booted
  from that base). `cmux-devbox-boot` regenerates them again on every clone,
  in a detached subshell so the daemon start never waits, so no two machines
  from one snapshot share a host key.
- **The journal starts over** in the cleanup step, so a machine's log begins
  under its own name instead of with the base's boot as `freestyle-vm`.

The `identity-final` step before the stamp re-runs the check plus a
whole-word residue audit (`freestyle-vm` under `/etc`, `/home`, `/root`,
`/usr/local`, `/opt`, package trees skipped). `verify-devbox-image.ts` proves
the same on a machine booted from the snapshot, plus the prompt a person sees
in a real pty for both accounts, a journal that knows no other name, and
different host keys on a second machine; `derive-devbox-sizes.ts` checks the
hostname on the master and on every derived size after its own boot.

What stays the provider's, on purpose, because the exec/fs API and the
transport run on it: the guest agent (`freestyle-vms-agent.service`,
`/sbin/freestyle-vms-agent`), its first-boot host-key unit
(`freestyle-vms-hostkeys.service`, inert once keys exist), the resolver
drop-in `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/60-freestyle-vms.conf`, the power-off
wrappers in `/usr/local/sbin`, the TLS-egress block in `/etc/hosts`, the
metadata service at 169.254.169.254, and the gateway endpoints
(`vm-ssh.freestyle.sh`, `*.vm.freestyle.sh`). Those name the platform
(`freestyle-vms`), never the machine, and the whole-word audit leaves them
alone. The container recipe has no identity step: `docker build` mounts
`/etc/hostname` and `/etc/hosts` from the daemon and the runtime names each
container, so the hostname there is the runtime's.

## Terminal capabilities (`cmux-terminfo.src`)

Daemon-spawned shells get the TERM the Mac exports (`xterm-256color`, or
`xterm-ghostty` when passed through) plus `COLORTERM=truecolor`, but
programs resolve TERM against the guest's terminfo. Stock ncurses
`xterm-256color` advertises no truecolor (`Tc`) or styled underlines (`Su`)
and emits SGR 90 for `setaf 8`, which the cmux renderer shows as invisible
ghost text. `cmux-terminfo.src` is the app's `Resources/terminfo-overlay`
(Ghostty's entry under both names, bright colors 8-15 as `38;5;n`) as
`infocmp -x` source; the bake compiles it into `/etc/terminfo`, ahead of
`/lib` and `/usr/share` in ncurses' search order, before seeding ble.sh's
per-TERM tput caches. Regenerate it from a cmux checkout with the command in
its header when the overlay changes; `vm-devbox-image.test.ts` compiles and
queries it, and `verify-devbox-image.ts` proves the same on a fresh machine.

## Session daemon: cmux-tui

Machines attach through the cmux-tui remote daemon on port 1337
(transport `cmux-remote`, docs/cloud-cmux-tui-daemon.md). The Freestyle bake
installs the pinned files.cmux.com build (sha256-verified, the driver's own
install command) at `/root/.cmux/bin/cmux-tui`, proves the daemon answers,
then parks it, because a Freestyle snapshot is a memory image and a live
daemon would give every machine the builder's Noise identity. The
`cmux-devbox-boot` supervisor, run by the baked `cmux-tui-daemon` systemd
unit with `CMUX_TUI_REMOTE_WS_BIND=[::]:1337` (the driver reaches the daemon
at the VM's IPv6 address, so the listener must be dual-stack), reads the
platform instance id from the metadata service, wipes the remote identity
when the machine is a clone, and starts the daemon. The driver runs no
bootstrap at create; it heals pin drift and a missing listener on attach
(`web/services/vms/drivers/cmuxTuiDaemon.ts`). The container Dockerfile still
ships only the supervisor and waits for a driver install.

Shells spawned by the daemon get the bash devshell (ble.sh ghost text,
half-life prompt, seeded history) through the `/etc/bash.bashrc` chain.

## Sizes: one bake, one snapshot per size

A Freestyle VM boots at its snapshot's size and resize is grow-only, so the
bake happens once on the ladder floor (`freestyle/ubuntu-sm`, 2 vCPU / 4 GiB /
16 GB) and `derive-devbox-sizes.ts` turns it into one snapshot per size:
boot the bake, `vm.resize`, snapshot, delete, then boot the derived snapshot
once more and check `nproc`, memory, the grown root filesystem and the
daemon/desktop units. Sizes are Freestyle's own ladder
(`web/services/vms/images/sizes.ts`, verbatim from freestyle-vms
`catalog/snapshots.json`), so every cmux machine is a shape Freestyle already
bills and caps:

| name | vCPU | memory | disk | Freestyle base |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sm` | 2 | 4 GiB | 16 GB | `freestyle/ubuntu-sm` |
| `md` | 4 | 8 GiB | 32 GB | `freestyle/ubuntu` |
| `lg` | 8 | 16 GiB | 64 GB | `freestyle/ubuntu-lg` |
| `lgx` | 12 | 24 GiB | 96 GB | derived snapshot |
| `xl` | 16 | 32 GiB | 128 GB | `freestyle/ubuntu-xl` |
| `2xl` | 32 | 64 GiB | 128 GB | `freestyle/ubuntu-2xl` |

The manifest records one entry per kind and size (`size: { name, cpu,
memoryMb, storageMb }`), each the default for its kind+size. The resolver
picks the smallest size whose memory covers the plan's `memoryMb`
(`defaultMemoryMbForPlan`; today's default of 8 GiB lands on `md`), so
the driver never resizes at create and nothing has to grow at boot. Snapshot
slugs are `cmux-devbox-<size>` (`cmux-devbox` for `md`).

Run `bun run devbox:manifest:check` before a promotion. It requires one
validated default for every size in both ladders and checks the recorded CPU,
memory, and disk values against `sizes.ts`.

### BusyBox probe

`freestyle/busybox` is not a supported machine image. It has only BusyBox
utilities and no systemd or cmux devbox contract. To measure whether a future
shell-only image can run cmux-tui, use the disposable probe:

```bash
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun run devbox:probe:busybox --fx
```

The probe installs the pinned static cmux-tui build, starts the daemon, runs the
small `fx` binary, records RSS, and deletes the VM. It never writes the image
manifest. A BusyBox result becomes a product option only after a separate
cmux-derived bake passes the same daemon, persistence, and attach checks as the
Ubuntu ladder.

## Promote: bake, verify, derive sizes, record (one command)

The checked-in manifest (`web/services/vms/images/manifest.json`) is the
only source of truth for the image users get: the resolver serves the entry
flagged `defaultForKind` for the requested kind and the plan's size, in local
dev and every deployed runtime alike, and no env var selects or overrides
it. `promote-devbox-image.ts` is the only sanctioned writer:

```bash
# from web/, with the Freestyle key in env
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle                     # bake -> verify -> sm,md,lg,lgx,xl,2xl -> manifest
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle --sizes lg,xl       # a subset of the ladder
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle --sizes none        # one size-less entry (pre-ladder behaviour)
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle --image sh-…        # verify + derive + record an existing bake
```

Snapshots are account-scoped: promote under the Freestyle account the
deployment's `FREESTYLE_API_KEY` belongs to, or the recorded ids are
unreachable from production.

It runs the stale-checkout preflight (`CMUX_BAKE_ALLOW_BRANCH=1` for
deliberate branch bakes), the bake, then `verify-devbox-image.ts`; only a
passing verify derives the sizes and writes the manifest, appending one
entry per kind and size flagged `defaultForKind` while demoting the
provider's previous defaults for those kind+size pairs (a sized promotion
also demotes size-less defaults: the ladder replaces the single-shape
image). Existing entries are never removed, so rollback is a manifest
revert. The last stdout line is `IMAGE_ID <id>` (the bake); `--out <json>`
writes the summary with every derived id. Commit the manifest diff in a PR;
merging it is the promotion.

## Bake and verify by hand

Each script refuses a stale checkout (`CMUX_BAKE_ALLOW_BRANCH=1` for
deliberate branch bakes). No local Docker and no daemon build are needed.

```bash
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun scripts/build-devbox-freestyle.ts cmux-devbox-<tag> [--no-desktop] [--replace-slug]
```

The container recipe builds and self-checks locally (amd64; the desktop
comes up under `cmux-devbox-boot` during the build and is torn down before
the image is committed):

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t cmux-devbox:dev services/vms/images/devbox
```

Freestyle bakes on `freestyle/ubuntu` (4 vCPU / 8 GiB / 32 GB): VMs always
boot at their snapshot's size and resizing is grow-only, so the builder's
shape is what every cmux Cloud machine gets. Freestyle snapshot slugs are
reassignable; the printed `sh-…` id is the pointer to pin. Agent pins live
only in the Dockerfile ARG defaults; bump them together with
`CMUX_IMAGE_EPOCH` and the chatmux template. The cmux-tui pin comes from
the artifacts manifest at deploy time (`CMUX_VM_CMUX_TUI_MANIFEST_URL`),
never from the image.

Each bake prints a `next` command. The verifier boots one VM from the
snapshot, asserts the toolchain, the exact agent pins, ghost text
under a tmux PTY, byte-identical baked files, the work user, and (when
`/etc/cmux/image-stamp` says `desktop`) the desktop contract (both ports,
RFB loopback-only, the session processes, the wallpaper on the root window,
one supervisor, `DISPLAY` in root's and `ubuntu`'s login shells,
`cua-driver doctor` seeing the display and the accessibility bus, every
desktop file byte-identical), then waits for
the baked daemon to come up on its own, asserts the daemon contract (current
pin, identity bound to this instance id) and that a second machine from the
snapshot holds a different daemon identity, and deletes both sandboxes:

```bash
bun scripts/verify-devbox-image.ts freestyle <sh-snapshot-id>
```

Only after verify passes may an entry carry `validationStatus: "passed"`;
`vm-image-manifest.test.ts` refuses a `defaultForKind` entry with any other
status. Machines created from the old cmuxd-remote images cannot serve the
`cmux-remote` transport and need recreation on a devbox image.

## Checking a private connection

A healthy daemon inside an image does not prove that a particular Mac client
can connect to it. Check the client and image together before replacing a
snapshot to address an attach failure:

```bash
# From web/, using the Freestyle account that owns this snapshot.
# Load FREESTYLE_API_KEY from ~/.secrets/cmux.env without printing it.
bun run devbox:verify:private-link sh-<snapshot-id> /path/to/cmux-tui
```

For a Mac app, use its `Contents/Resources/bin/cmux-tui` binary. The probe
first requires the client's `wireguard-hub` capability; an older client must
be updated before a private-network image can be assessed. Rebuilding a guest
image cannot add that missing capability to an installed Mac app.

The probe creates its own VPC, VM from the requested snapshot, and temporary
WireGuard tunnel. It uses the production driver to confirm the machine serves
the trusted-carrier listener, dials it with `--carrier` (no enrollment, no
approval), reads the session snapshot through the private hub, then connects
again the same way. The report records both commits and the trusted-listener,
reconnect, and snapshot results.
The client need not match the image's older baked commit: successful protocol
operations are the compatibility check.

Keys and invitations are held in an owner-only temporary directory. Processes,
VM, tunnel, and VPC are cleaned up on success and failure; Deletion retries only explicit provider conflict responses with bounded
exponential backoff; only a successful delete confirms completion. Permanent
refusals fail immediately, and each resource cleanup has a 30-second deadline. The probe never opens
public ingress, installs a system VPN, or changes an existing machine. A
cleanup failure names the resource requiring operator attention and fails the
command. Run this alongside `devbox:verify` when validating a new image or a
new Cloud client.
